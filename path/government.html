      At its core The Pantry’s mission is to feed community members in need. The site was primarily being used by donors to give to the group and on occasion by people in need to find the donation location.
      Problem Statement:The Food Pantry’s main mission is to feed hungry people and empower them to help each other. We learned that The Food Pantry has been having a hard time finding volunteers, attracting donors and informing families in need. 
      Solution: Improve the quality of the website by improving functionality and enhancing the visuals to serve the community.

      We did non-profit website redesign focused on The Food Pantry, a San Francisco food bank which has been operating for over 20 years. We had a lot of trouble finding a non profit we could communicate with spending days on the selection process but knew we had landed on the right project when talking to Michael, The Pantry Operations Director. Feeding over 500 families a week through the years and even during the unique challenges Covid-19 presented.
