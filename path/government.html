                      <p>The non-profit website redesign is focused on The Food Pantry, a San Francisco food bank which has been operating for over 20 years, feeding over 500 families a week through the years and even during the unique challenges Covid-19 presented.</p>

                        <p>At its core The Pantry’s mission is to feed community members in need. The site was primarily being used by donors to give to the group and on occasion by people in need to find the donation location.</p>
                        <p><b>Statement: </b>The Food Pantry’s main mission is to feed hungry people and empower them to help each other. We learned that The Food Pantry has been having a hard time finding volunteers, attracting donors and informing families in need. </p>

                      When interviewing Michael we identified his feelings on the website, with him stating it’s not the greatest and that the group needs $20,000 a year at minimum to handle operations. The site as currently constructed is more of a blog.  Michael also stated the website was used mostly to take donations and that the group had been having trouble attracting volunteers during covid.
                      We continued our research by analyzing the current website. We conducted a survey and 5 second tests. While our participation wasn’t as strong as we hoped we did gain some valuable insight. Most people were willing to volunteer and donate but didn’t know where to turn. Survey responders found out about charities from multiple sources but must agree with the groups mission and trust the charity. The website plays a large part in building that trust.

                      The current Food Pantry page is constructed more like a blog than a contemporary webpage. When tested users complained about multiple issues that include, but are not limited to:
                      <ul>
                        <li>No clear donate button</li>
                        <li>The menu bar being too small</li>
                        <li>The mission statement not being visible</li>
                        <li>Navigation issues</li>

                      After learning more about our charity and our users we created a user persona for the Sakharov family. Andrei, Tatiana and two young children.
                  
                      We created a User Journey to empathize with the user and find out how they would feel during every step of the process. While Tatiana and Andrei started out sad and concerned, things began to look up when they visited the Food Pantry Website. Their user experience brought them joy and hope.

                      We laid out our sections and sketched our pages digitally with some low fidelity prototypes. All of our group members had a hand in designing the homepage with each individual member being responsible for other pages. We all came together everyday to unify the design.
                      In order to make a responsive product for The Food Pantry we also created a mobile version of the website with roughly the same collaborative process. Coming together to make key design decisions on the mobile homepage followed by building individual pages.

                      When testing our redesigned website the feedback was generally positive with users saying it was easy to navigate and the dedicated buttons were easier to find that a tab section. Some negative feedback was given like missing buttons which were fixed during the next iterations.

                      During our interview with shareholders we found out a lot of the community members who The Food Pantry serves are Russian and Spanish speakers and we would like to implement those translated languages. 
                      We had a chance to show the redesign website to the shareholders during the meeting and got very good feedback about it. Also based on feedback and notes taken during the shareholdes meeting we implemented new changes.
                      Implementing a feedback and reviews page is another idea we played with for the future.
