      How it Started

    <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 ">
        We did non-profit website redesign focused on The Food Pantry, a San Francisco food bank which has been operating for over 20 years. We had a lot of trouble finding a non profit we could communicate with spending days on the selection process but knew we had landed on the right project when talking to Michael, The Pantry Operations Director. Feeding over 500 families a week through the years and even during the unique challenges Covid-19 presented.
