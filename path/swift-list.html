                      <p>The original objective of our project was to create a grocery shopping app. The app we designed is called Swift List. There are many apps focusing on food and shopping, and we wanted to become familiar with these types of interfaces while also designing a feature that sets our app apart from the others. </p>

                    During the empathy phase of our design process, we interviewed a pool of 5 people about their grocery shopping habits and found that users have a hard time keeping track of which stores carry their specific, preferred items. One person said that she has notes where she writes down the stores that carry her preferred items, but it’s not super organized.<br>
                    We thought, what if our app had a way to show you routes to the stores that carry the items on your grocery list, essentially planning your trip for the user, assuring that the stores they are going to will have the items they seek.

                    The current Food Pantry page is constructed more like a blog than a contemporary webpage. When tested users complained about multiple issues that include, but are not limited to:
                    <ul>
                      <li>No clear donate button</li>

                    After learning more about our charity and our users we created a user persona for the Sakharov family. Andrei, Tatiana and two young children.
                
                    We created a User Journey to empathize with the user and find out how they would feel during every step of the process. While Tatiana and Andrei started out sad and concerned, things began to look up when they visited the Food Pantry Website. Their user experience brought them joy and hope.

                    We laid out our sections and sketched our pages digitally with some low fidelity prototypes. All of our group members had a hand in designing the homepage with each individual member being responsible for other pages. We all came together everyday to unify the design.
                    In order to make a responsive product for The Food Pantry we also created a mobile version of the website with roughly the same collaborative process. Coming together to make key design decisions on the mobile homepage followed by building individual pages.

                    When testing our redesigned website the feedback was generally positive with users saying it was easy to navigate and the dedicated buttons were easier to find that a tab section. Some negative feedback was given like missing buttons which were fixed during the next iterations.

                    We learned many things during this project. Now we have a deeper understanding of grocery shopping apps and  other types of list apps, which are plentiful and useful to know as designers. We realized that we could have tested the navigation a bit earlier,  which would have saved some time during iterations. 
                   We also learned that edit icons especially have a wide range of meaning and could be confused with many other actions.
                   In the future, we want to do more user testing to see if our final prototype needs additional changes, or if other features would be useful-  like statistics about the user’s spending and dietary habits, or price comparisons.
                   We also want to make an onboarding process that includes tooltips and explore some other changes.
